I think the main part of computation in C-PS is more about selecting existing paths rather than calculate the path based on some requirements. It is also reflected in the name of C-PS(selector).

It not only assumes that CATS routers are distinct from IP/MPLS routers of the underlay (which is highly debatable).

It miht only have a control plane connection with the attached Egress CATS-forwarder,  so the only way is to send the route/CS-ID with the metrics to the egress CATS-Forwarder. Then the Egress CATS-Forwarder will do the rest.

Centralized designs where the computing-related metrics from the C-SMAs are collected by a (logically) centralized path computation logic (like a Path Computation Element (PCE) {{?RFC4655}}) that also collects network metrics may, thus, be adopted. In the latter case, the (logically) centralized CATS computation logic may process incoming service requests to compute and select paths let alone service instances.

Such information could indeed disclose intel about the network and the location of compute resources hosted in edge sites. This information may be used by an attacker to identify weak spots in an operator's network. Furthermore, such information may be modified by an attacker resulting in disrupted service delivery for the clients, up to and including misdirection of traffic to an attacker's service implementation. CATS solutions must support authentication and integrity-protection mechanisms between C-SMAs/C-NMAs and C-PSes, and between C-PSes and Ingress CATS-Routers. Also, C-SMA agents need to support a mechanism to authenticate the services for which they provide information to C-PS computation logics, among other CATS functions.\r\n```",
